 * anything, so the only decorative motion left is the blink, and it shares no
 * vocabulary with the rest. Reading sweeps, searching darts, editing presses,
 * running ratchets — and when a permission request lands the mark stops dead
 * and looks at you, because stillness is the loudest thing available when
 * everything else moves.
 *
 * Once real text starts arriving it collapses into the three dots every
 * messages app uses. The eyes already sit twelve units either side of centre,
 * so the row they fall into is the one they were always standing on.
